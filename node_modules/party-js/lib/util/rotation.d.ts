/**
 * Converts the specified euler rotation (in degrees) into the corresponding normal vector.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The normal is calculated by placing a (figurative) plane in a coordinate-system's
 * origin, and rotating it by the specified angles. Note that the z-component of the
 * rotation is irrelevant for the normal and can be ignored. Then, two vectors
 * describing the orientation of the plane are calculated. Their cross product
 * denotes the normal vector.
 *
 * @param rotation The euler rotation angles (in degrees) to calculate the normal for.
